# In these exercises, you'll be defining methdods, so you start only with a set of requirements for each one.

# the requirements will always start with the name of the function
# then they'll describe what the function should do

# here's an example of some requirements

# add_ten
# takes one number as an arg
# adds ten and returns the new value
# example: the arg is 5
# returns 15

# and here's the solution

def add_ten(number):
  return number + 10


# TIP: some solutions will require more than one line of code

# now it's over to you!

# say_hello
# takes no args
# returns 'hello'

# say_goodbye
# takes no args
# returns 'goodbye'

# say_hello_to
# takes one string as an arg
# example: the arg is `Sam`
# returns `Hello, Sam`

# say_goodbye_to
# takes one string as an arg
# example: the arg is `Sam`
# returns `Goodbye, Sam`

# square
# takes one number as an arg
# multiplies that number by itself
# returns the new value

# divisible_by_three
# takes one number as an arg
# returns true if the number is divisible by three
# returns false if the number is not divisible by three

# add
# takes two numbers as args
# adds them together
# returns the total

# multiply
# takes two numbers as args
# multiplies one by the other
# returns the result

# add_number_strings
# takes two numbers as strings
# converts them both to numbers
# returns the total

# multiply_number_strings
# takes two numbers as strings for args
# converts them both to numbers
# multiplies one by the other
# returns the result

# both_odd
# takes two numbers as args
# returns true if both are odd
# otherwise, returns false

# both_even
# takes two numbers as args
# returns true if both are even
# otherwise, returns false

# one_odd
# takes two numbers as args
# returns true if at least one of them is odd
# otherwise, returns false

# one_even
# takes two numbers as args
# returns true if at least one of them is even
# otherwise returns false

# truncate_string
# takes one string as an arg
# if the string is longer than 10 characters
# returns the first 10 chars followed by '...'
# if the string is 10 chars or less
# returns the whole string
