# Purpose: implements a childhood game
# Rules:   if the number is divisible by 3, return 'fizz'

#          otherwise, return the number
# Clue: you can check divisibility using modulo (%)
# Example:
#   Call:    fizz_buzz(3)
#   Returns: "fizz"
#   Call:    fizz_buzz(5)
#   Returns: "buzz"
#   Call:    fizz_buzz(15)
#   Returns: "fizzbuzz"
