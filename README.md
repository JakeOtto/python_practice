# Python Foundations

## Learning objectives

In this section, you'll learn how to write programs using Python which will, necessarily, involve learning Python's syntax. Along the way, you'll also learn about [problem decomposition](./pills/problem_decomposition.md), [debugging](./pills/debugging.md) and [experimenting in the Python REPL](./pills/repl.md). <!-- OMITTED -->

#### By the end of the module, you will be able to

- Execute Python code in two different ways
- Make a plan using problem decomposition and experimentation
- Describe and use variables
- Describe and use conditionals
- Describe and use lists
- Describe and use dictionaries
- Describe and be able to use loops to iterate through iterable objects
- Describe and use methods & functions
- Describe and use classes
- Build programs using all of the above!

## Structure

There are 3 chapters to work through. The first chapter introduces a range of new concepts and which are built upon, and added to, as you progress through the other chapters. This process of introducing something and then revisiting it later on is called _spiralling_.

As you progress you'll be given challenges at several points, which you must complete before moving on. There are two types of challenge - _drills_ and _programs_.

> The three chapters are broken up into sections, each of which has both text and video versions.

### Progress Tracking

To help your coach provide the right support, at the right time, please **log your progress at the end of each section using the form provided at that point**. It should only take a few seconds.

### Drills

These challenges are really tightly focused and repetitive. The goal is to become familiar with the basic building blocks of programming.

> You'll be asked to zip up and share your solutions to these exercises so that your coach can see what you're learning and what you need to focus on next.
### Programs

These challenges require you to bring those basic building blocks together and build a useful program.

> You'll be asked to do a screen recording when working on this challenge so that your coaches can see what you're learning and what you need to focus on next.
